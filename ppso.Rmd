Parallel Optomization Test using PPSO
========================================================


Introduction to ppso - Particle Swarm Optomization
====

The package provides a few dummy functions to show it works - here is the rastrigin function that apparently is commonly used to test optimzation (new to me!)

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Rastrigin_function.png)


```{r}
require(ppso)
#simple application (all file I/O disabled)
  result <- optim_pso(objective_function=rastrigin_function, projectfile=NULL, logfile=NULL)
  print (result)

#actual minimum -2 at (0,0) 
	result = optim_dds(objective_function=rastrigin_function, projectfile=NULL, logfile=NULL)
	print (result)
```

The arguments take in a function that is evaluate at x, and a list of parameters.

Creating own function, let's start simple
Let’s take a look with some data found in ?mle2

```{r}
x = 0:10
y = c(26, 17, 13, 12, 20, 5, 9, 8, 5, 4, 8)
d = data.frame(x, y)
```

Here, we’re fitting a possion model that depends on an intercept term plus a linear term. The exp() is mainly there to make sure that the value of lambda doesn’t go negative, which isn’t allowed (it would imply a negative number of occurrences for our outcome of interest).

```{r}
require(bbmle)
#using R's native optim function()
fit0 = mle2(y ~ dpois(lambda= exp(intercept + slope * x)), start = list(intercept = mean(y), slope = 0), data = d)

#now the same exact code written as a function, how do i do this?
simpleF<-function(intercept=mean(y),slope=0){
  -sum(dpois(y,lambda = exp(intercept + slope * x)),log=TRUE)
}

#test
simpleF()

fit1 = mle2(simpleF, start = list(intercept = mean(y), slope = 0))

fit1
fit0
```

Clearly we have a syntax issue.
===============================

fit0 and fit1, why do i get diff results?
